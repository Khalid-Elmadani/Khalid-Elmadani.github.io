I am a Research Assistant at the [Computational Approaches to Modeling Language (CAMeL)](https://camel-lab.com/) Lab at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), advised by Professor [Nizar Habash](https://www.nizarhabash.com/).
I am currently working on tools for Arabic Readability Assessment as part of the [Balanced Arabic Readability Evaluation Corpus (BAREC)](https://barec.camel-lab.com/) project.

Previously, I completed my Master’s by Dissertation in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town, where I was part of the [UCT NLP](https://www.janmbuys.com/uctnlp/index.html) group under the supervision of Dr. [Jan Buys](https://www.janmbuys.com/). My research focused on Neural Machine Translation between low-resource languages. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Khartoum in Sudan.

I am broadly interested in building NLP systems for linguistically diverse and underrepresented languages.
